# Introduction
This 2D engine will be produced via an online series from my youtube channel: Let's make games. 
You can watch and learn the skills required to do this here: https://goo.gl/VERhC5

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	You will need SDL2, SDL_image 
2.	After downloading the project ensure that you correctly link the lib's and dll's.
3.	Releases will be commited weekly to the main branch.
4.	API references can be found here: https://wiki.libsdl.org/

# Build and Test
There are no special build requirements as of yet. Please ensure that you have the correct target output for the
linked lib's and dll's.
